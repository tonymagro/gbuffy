	* gtklib.c: fix coredump when you cancel the imap password dialog

	* acconfig.h, config.h.in, configure, configure.in:
	add --enable-dfile flag to enable debug (couldn't use enable-debug, autoconf wouldn't let me)

	* acconfig.h, config.c, config.h.in, configure, configure.in, gbconfig.c, gbuffy.h, imap.c, msocket.c, msocket.h:
	ssl support from Eivind Tagseth <eivindt@multinet.no>

	* imap.c:
	clear headers so we don't get duplication of xface on imap, from Toby Speight via debian

	* gbuffy.1: man page from Era Eriksson via debian

	* gbuffy.c: new default mailbox command from debian

	* gbconfig.c:
	disable Vertical config if we're an applet (from Cyrille Chepelov via debian)

	* gbuffy.c, gbuffy.h: no subject patch from Diego

	* ChangeLog, imap.c, libcompface/cmain.c: fixes from Grant Edwards

	* count.c:
	support .sylpheed_mark and .mh_sequences for mh folders, and fix bug where we didn't show any headers for maildir folders

2003-10-06  Grant Edwards <grante@visi.com>

        * gbuffy.c: made debug file non-buffered.
        
        * gbuffy.c: fixed g_print() of position data so it
          compiles.
          
        * imap.c: fixed parsing of STATUS response to tolerate
          servers that return mailbox name in quotes.
          
        * imap.c: changed default value from 0 to 1 for
          starting seq number for FETCH command.  First message
          is 1: 0 isn't legal.
          
        * libcompface/cmain.c: got rid of obsolete usage of
          errno/sys_errlist and replaced it with strerror().

	* xfaceviewer: add another ascii image viewer

	* xfaceviewer:
	shell script to extract an X-Face header from a file and display it
	using various tools.  Useful for a program like mutt.

	* gbuffy.c:
	Fix debian bug # 40877, the xface header is reversed (hard to tell on a
	face, but apparently the following small 'e' didn't work:
	X-Face: +Qsu;P5#YFS#6y2P?[c.3/h=%S1hO(k^ehU0]?L|y'1JzyRsI|Kp};

	* ChangeLog: Updated change log for release

	* count.c:
	fix bug where zero length file causes us to not update the count

1999-01-14  Brandon Long  <blong@non>

	* count.c: Fix bugs in mh counting
	Hmm, at some point, we probably need to handle .mh_sequences

1999-01-13  Brandon Long  <blong@non>

	* Makefile.in: Add install target

	* ChangeLog, CHANGES: updated for version 0.2.1

	* nntp.c: Fixing bugs in NNTP support
	- subject/from parsing backwards in XOVER
	- increase size of buffer for reading XOVER
	- not quite stepping the line right in XOVER

1999-01-11  Brandon Long  <blong@non>

	* count.c, gbuffy.h, ChangeLog, Makefile.in:
	- rcs2log entry for creating a ChangeLog
	- fixed bug where st_mtime is a #define under Solaris

	* configure.in, configure, autogen.sh, Makefile.in:
	Makefile/autoconf changes for 0.2 release

	* nntp.c, lib.c, newsrc.c, gtkrc.example, imap.c, gbuffy.h, gtkrc, gbuffy.c, count.c, gbconfig.c, README, config.c, BUGS, Makefile.in:
	Added NNTP mailbox support
	Changed STRING_LEN to STRING
	Updated README for 0.20 release
	Updated config dialogs to support IMAP and NNTP mailboxes
	Changed From/Subject dialog popup back to XBuffy style, where it goes
	  away when you release the button.  Probably add a variable to control
	  this later (on some window managers, you automatically get the leave
	  notification with the popup, which negates the paradigm we were
	  shooting for)
	Renamed gtkrc to gtkrc.example as GTK+ now sources ~/.gtkrc
	Removed call to gtk_rc_parse(), as GTK+ now sources ~/.gtkrc automatically
	Fixed a couple bugs in the config save routines to prevent bad config
	  files from being written (shouldn't libproplist handle this?)
